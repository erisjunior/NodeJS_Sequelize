## Node.js + PostgreSQL + Sequelize

In this project, based on this [Rocketseat Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbu7z5dXcRs&t=0s), where I could understand more about Node.js with SQL Databases using Sequelize.
Some nice things:

- Init with Sequelize and SQL
- Database configurations
- Migrations concept
- Sequelize Models
- Creating Controllers
- Creating associations between models (relations)
  - 1 - N (belongsTo - hasMany)
  - N - N (belongsToMany - belongsToMany)
